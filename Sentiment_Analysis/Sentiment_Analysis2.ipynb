Most Apple retail employees are interesting and intelligent young people who participate in various activities outside of work -- outdoor sports, music, art, university, digital media, etc.  There is room for growth within Apple retail, but it will likely take a long while before one reaches corporate from there, if ever. Apple does provide opportunities for retail employees to participate in \"on-campus\" learning experiences at the Cupertino headquarters. They also have a leadership program (ASLP) for store employees to gain knowledge of every level of the retail experience the company provides.

They want their phones fixed, and they want them fixed now, which for some reason causes your average consumer to lose their humanity. People assume that it\\'s Apple\\'s fault that they dropped their device in the toilet (90% of the water damaged phones), or that the screen was faulty because they dropped it 10ft onto the concrete and it cracked. Everyone else in line be damned, they\\'re time is more important and they demand to be seen first. People also don\\'t understand the very basic principles of a warranty. \"I know it\\'s out of warranty, but my 5-year-old phone isn\\'t as loud as it used to be. I didn\\'t do anything. Apple should replace it for free.\"  The FRS is not only responsible for taking these iPhone appointments every 10 minutes (a very demanding time limit per appointment), but are also tasked with teaching One-to-One customers with 30 minute and 1 hour personal training sessions. The amount of knowledge you\\'re required to absorb (mostly on your own time since Apple is only really interested in teaching customer service during training) is immense, and insures that you\\'ll be discussing work-related issues during your breaks.  You have no downtime with this job. On one hand, the day goes quicker when you\\'re shotgunning tech support to 40+ customers, but it gets taxing. The front of the store (normal \"Specialists\") who are tasked with working basic sales and the like, are given as much time per customer as they see fit. If you want to spend your days interacting with your coworkers rather than rushing through appointments, take this job instead. It pays a dollar or so less, on average, but is an entirely different experience when it comes to working at the Apple Store.  Also, the hours are erratic. As a part-time job, the FRS position takes up ALL of your time. This is because you\\'re scheduled only a few hours per day, almost EVERY day. It\\'s hard to predict what your hours will be, week to week, which makes it impossible to schedule something in your free time. You have to give a minimum of 3 weeks notice to get a day off, and it\\'s not guaranteed that they\\'ll give it to you. On top of this, all the other FRS\\'s are working a minimum of 5 days a week, and because Apple has to pay time-and-a-half on the 6th day, nobody else is allowed to cover your shift.',\n",

       " ['If you don\\'t work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.  Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.  Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That\\'s often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at \"turf war.\"  A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.  There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google\\'s specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.  Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.  There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn\\'t. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It\\'s discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn\\'t outright deny it, but it\\'s formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It\\'s more like a missing pro.  Another shining star that\\'s gone is the \"don\\'t be evil\" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with \"do the right thing.\" Google didn\\'t turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.  If you work there and want to advance your career, don\\'t volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a \"vacation\" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You\\'ll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.  You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion).

This system rewards and recognizes self-promoters at the expense of quieter, but solid contributors. You never feel like you\\'ve done enough and can relax.  Poor work/life balance. Microsoft is stubbornly reluctant to open up to working from home, when many other companies have already embraced it. There is a well worn sentiment internally that we tout software that helps remote teams collaborate, yet we refuse to.  Consultants are expected to travel 100% (Mon-Thu) with little flexibility or sympathy for its impact on their personal lives. Management sentiment is that you can\\'t complain because you get paid well. You do (and your bonus depends on your hours), but they get zero points for sensitivity.  Most of the pressure to be on site every week comes from our own management, even when customers are flexible.  Consultants have a quota of billable hours to meet annually. This quota does not include travel time, which you have to make up.  There is a strong Kool-Aid atmosphere. The sense of blind passion often feels phony, as if we\\'re all trying to act out our slogan. Internal training videos remind us how excited we are about our products and what we can do to share that excitement. Probably because of the ranking system, people compete to out-passion each other and everything is \"awesome\". I\\'ve seen consultants express regret at the cancellation of a high profile status meeting. It just feels fake, but I understand where it comes from. If you\\'re not passionate enough, you might not get a good rating. I don\\'t think this is a heathy culture. Real passion and excitement comes with a counterdose of skepticism and criticism. The latter is conspicuously rare. Senior management must understand that merely soliciting feedback and holding open office hours is not enough when you have the cloud of a ranking system hanging over your head.

They appear to exemplify the phrase: \"The end justifies the means\".  * Honest hard work may go unnoticed if you are not politically connected to the right people.  * Managers are empowered to decide upon their direct report\\'s fate within the company - having almost uncontested authority to promote or fire anyone reporting to them. Moreover, the system lacks of appropriate check and balances to effectively apprehend potential managerial misconduct.  Therefore, the KEY to succeed and grow within the company is: Instead of looking for a new role within the company, you should always be scouting for good managers that could potentially hire you into their team. In other words, having a good manager matters more than landing upon your dream job.  * On several occasions, over a period of 6 plus years, I\\'ve seen how HR sides with management instead of objectively assess what could be at stake in any given situation or complaint. Employee morale and passion keeps declining - the majority adopts a \"See no evil, Hear no Evil\" attitude in order to survive or spare retaliation from management.  * It was of great disappointment not only to witness highly-unethical behavior coming from middle management, but to see how upper management looked the other way.  * Although Microsoft is still a great company to work for and to list in a resume, I would recommend that if looking for a new workplace, to look at other great companies that will probably enrich more anyone\\'s professional career. If you are already working for Microsoft, then take pride in what you do while understanding that the company is going through a challenging phase - and always keep in mind that the best thing to do is to do the right thing.',\n",

Limited career growth opportunities within and external due to support tag. Internal Job openings are opened later, people to be hired identified first.
