# Natural-Language-Processing

Natural Language processing is a wide domain covering concepts of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It is used to analyse text or how humans speak. One of the applications of NLP is Semantic Analysis (Understanding the meaning of text)

# Introduction to  NLTK library for Python

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to many corpora and lexical resources. Also, it contains a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. Best of all, NLTK is a free, open source, community-driven project.
The Basics of NLP for Text:

Tokenization: Splitting sentences and words from the body of text.

Stop Words: Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words. Stop words can be filtered from the text to be processed.

Text Lemmatization and Stemming: For grammatical reasons, documents can contain different forms of a word such as drive, drives, driving. The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.

The main difference between these terms is-  stemming technique only looks at the form of the word whereas lemmatization technique looks at the meaning of the word.

Bag-of-Words: The bag-of-words model is a popular and simple feature extraction technique used when we work with text. It describes the occurrence of each word within a document.

TF-IDF: Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus.
